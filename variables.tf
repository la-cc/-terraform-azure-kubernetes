  When deploying an AKS Cluster, local accounts are enabled by default.
  Even when enabling RBAC or Azure Active Directory integration, --admin access still exists, essentially as a non-auditable backdoor option.
  With this in mind, AKS offers users the ability to disable local accounts via a flag, disable-local-accounts.
  A field, properties.disableLocalAccounts, has also been added to the managed cluster API to indicate whether the feature has been enabled on the cluster.

    The following limitations apply when you create an AKS cluster using availability zones:

    - You can only enable availability zones when the cluster is created.
    - Availability zone settings can't be updated after the cluster is created.
    - You also can't update an existing, non-availability zone cluster to use availability zones.
    - You can't disable availability zones for an AKS cluster once it has been created.
    - The node size (VM SKU) selected must be available across all availability zones.
    - Clusters with availability zones enabled require use of Azure Standard Load Balancers for distribution across zones.
    - You must use Kubernetes version 1.13.5 or greater in order to deploy Standard Load Balancers.

    Disk limitations

    Volumes that use Azure managed disks are currently not zonal resources.
    Pods rescheduled in a different zone from their original zone can't reattach their previous disk(s).
    It's recommended to run stateless workloads that don't require persistent storage that may come across zonal issues.
    If you must run stateful workloads, use taints and toleration's in your pod specs to tell the Kubernetes scheduler to create pods in the same zone as your disks.
    Alternatively, use network-based storage such as Azure Files that can attach to pods as they're scheduled between zones.
